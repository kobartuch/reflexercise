WHAT IS REFLEXERCISE?

Reflexercise is a small, open source point-and-click game which tests the users reflexes and reaction speed as well as accuracy of mouse clicks. The game consists of a series of targets which pop up one by one at random intervals on the users screen and wait for short intervals of time before disappearing. Eventually, more than one target will pop up at a time, requiring the user to become quicker at reacting. 
Reflexercise also contains a built-in mp3 player which allows the user to play music while playing the game without having to open VLC,iTunes,etc.
